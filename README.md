# Motivation

I started this site because I’ve used remove.bg constantly since high school as an avid photographer and editor. My parents never had the chance to travel outside their hometowns in small towns in China, so they wanted to give me and my brother an immersive, worldly experience. We took road trips and vacations often- from the islands of Hawaii to the beaches of Florida to the mountains of Virginia- so I was always taking photos and editing them to share on Instagram. For this site, I wanted to build a product for other passionate photographers and editors that streamlines their work: calm, fast, and obvious. Upload once, see the preview instantly, and never wonder what happens next.

The goal is to make background removal feel as satisfying as hitting “send” on a great email: one clean action that gives you a shareable, ready‑to‑use result.
