## Showcase summary

Image Transform Studio turns a multi‑tool workflow into a single action. Upload once, watch clear progress, and receive a hosted PNG with a transparent background plus a mirrored version ready for reuse.

### Why it feels production‑ready
- Focused flow with a live process rail so users always understand progress.
- Real hosted URLs and deletion support, not placeholders or mock assets.
- TypeScript backend with clear API boundaries and strong error handling.
- A server‑backed gallery shows recent successful transformations.
- One‑click sample image demo removes first‑use friction.
- Inline timing badges surface real performance.
- Lightweight request logging keeps ops visibility simple.

### What this demonstrates
- Product instincts: minimal steps, high clarity, strong feedback.
- Engineering rigor: clean pipeline, secure keys, durable storage.
- Open‑source quality: documented decisions and clear setup guidance.
- Measurement discipline: repeatable metrics harness and test coverage.
